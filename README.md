# QOTD Bot

This is a Slack bot that automates the process of submitting "Questions Of The Day" to users in a public channel. Currently deployed in Soartech's channel, #qotd. It is capable of taking in user-submitted questions with answers, comparing those answers to user attempts, and keeping track of scores for correct answers.
In a public channel, call the bot with @qotd_bot at the beginning of your message (commands don't use "/"). Alternatively, you can start a private chat with the bot and just talk to it directly, without "@qotd_bot". Some commands like `answer are not permitted to run in a public channel.
If you're ever lost, say "@qotd_bot help" for a list of commands, or just ask me.
Additionally, if you encounter any bugs or have any feature requests, let me know!
